# Packet-Capture-Analysis-PCA-Tool

Network engineers and security analysts are often interested in analyzing network packet captures to then analyze network activity

Network activity analysis may result in outcomes such as introducing additional network components for load balancing, new routes/paths through the network, or spinning up further analysis for confirming networking breaches.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a Packet Capture Analysis (PCA) tool that computes metrics from these packet captures that could be used in decision making.
